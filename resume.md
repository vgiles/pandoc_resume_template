SUMMARY
-----------

I am an exceptionally honest and diligent goatherd. I am looking for new
opportunities in herd management.


EXPERIENCE
-----------


**Senior Goatherd**
Evil Corp (Rockville) *10/2015 - present*

As Senior Goatherd, I oversee the work of one Junior Goatherd. I am
responsible for the lives of 18 full grown goats (currently).

Developed GPS tracking of all goats, with data stream uploaded to AWS
and lambda functions to alert when goats stray. This software is called
"Internet of Goats" and it is available on github.com.

Technologies used: sheepdog, cane, javascript, AWS Kinesis, AWS IoT.

**Goatherd First Class**
Evil Corp (Rockville) *1/2010 - 10/2015*

As a First Class Goatherd, I was responsible for half of our whole herd
during the swing shift hours of 2PM to 1:45AM. I was awarded the use of
a sheepdog and the mayor once thanked me.

Published the article "On the intelligence of herd animals - a
comparative report from the field" in Journal of Comparative
Contemporary Herding, vol.Â 323 (2015).


**Junior Goatherd**
Evil Corp (Rockville) *10/1999 - 1/2010*

As Junior Goatherd, I was responsible for watching the herd during the
graveyard shift for my first nine years on the job. After stellar
performance I was rapidly promoted to swing shift in 2010.
